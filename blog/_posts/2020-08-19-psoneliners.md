## Objective

This post aims to document some useful one-liners I've come across as part of
everyday usage of PowerShell. Hopefully, you'll find some of these powerful,
time-saving, and fun to play around with!

Many of these one-liners were taken from various blogs, social media, etc., and
are not necessarily my own.

## Prerequisites

Windows PowerShell 5.1 (unless otherwise specified), usually run as administrator

## Background

Part of learning PowerShell is simply writing code and getting a feel for what
the output should look like. Go ahead, copy and of these one-liners into your
PowerShell console. What do you expect to see? What did you actually see?
