I"¦<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Dan. I have an unhealthy addiction to automation and SRE practices.</p>

<p class="faded">Learning is my biggest motivator.</p>

<p>I created this personal website as a means to self-document interesting problems
Iâ€™ve solved, and share those solutions with the world, in the hopes that they
will help otherâ€™s running into similar issues.</p>
