<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>

<p class="faded">When I think about what truly makes me happy â€” itâ€™s travel.</p>

<p>At 22, I set the goal of traveling to 30 countries before turning 30.
At 22, Iâ€™d only been to 1 country outside the US. By 26, I traveled to 29 countries in
4 years, and hit my goal well ahead of time. Onwards to experiencing more
cultures â€” and possibly 40 countries before 40.</p>
