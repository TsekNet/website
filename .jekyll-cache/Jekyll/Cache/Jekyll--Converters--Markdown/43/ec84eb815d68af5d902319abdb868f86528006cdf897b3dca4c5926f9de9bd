<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Learning is my biggest motivator.
{:.faded}</p>
<p>Windows Systems Administrator with an unhealthy addiction to automation and SRE
practices.</p>
<p>With over 5 years experience in IT, my primary areas of focus are
PowerShell, Python, automation, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, Infrastructure as
Code, Windows imaging, Configuration Management, and championing SRE practices.</p>
<p>I help maintain the open-source Windows Imaging tool developed at Google
(<a href="https://github.com/google/glazier">Glazier</a>).</p>
<p>My aim is to work on open-source projects long term both professionally and personally.</p>
<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>When I think about what truly makes me happy — it’s travel.
{:.faded}</p>
<p>At 22, I set the goal of traveling to 30 countries before turning 30.
At 22, I’d only been to 1 country outside the US. By 26, I traveled to 29 countries in
4 years, and hit my goal well ahead of time. Onwards to experiencing more
cultures — and possibly 40 countries before 40.</p>
