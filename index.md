Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a Windows SRE @ Google.

This website aims to document *interesting* tech problems I've
solved, and share those solutions with the world in the hopes that it will make
your life easier.

TsekNet is a play on words: my last name ([**Tsek**hanskiy](/about#last-name)) + Microsoft's Tech**Net**.
