# =======================================================================================
# This file contains all soft-coded strings of the theme.
# You can edit them here if you want to change the wording of certain phrases,
# e.g. maybe you prefer "Fetchingâ€¦" to "Loadingâ€¦", etc.
#
# You can also use this to "translate" the theme into different langauges,
# but note that this may not work in all situations,
# especially for languages that differ significantly from English.
