Windows Systems Administrator with an unhealthy addiction to automation and [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering)
practices.

With over five years of experience in IT, my primary areas of focus are
PowerShell, Python, automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery,
infrastructure as code, imaging/provisioning, configuration management,
and championing SRE practices.

At Google, I help maintain our open-source Windows imaging tool
([Glazier](https://github.com/google/glazier)).

I ‚ù§Ô∏è open-source. I aim to work entirely on open-source projects both
professionally and personally.

At 22, I set the goal of traveling to 30 countries before turning 30.
At 22, I'd only been to 1 country outside the US. By 26, I traveled to 29 countries in
4 years, and hit my goal well ahead of time. Onwards to experiencing more
cultures ‚Äî and possibly 40 countries before 40.
