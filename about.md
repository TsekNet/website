## Work

Learning is my biggest motivator.
{:.faded}

Windows Systems Administrator with an unhealthy addiction to automation and [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering)
practices.

With over five years of experience in IT, my primary areas of focus are
PowerShell, Python, automation, CI/CD, infrastructure as code,
imaging/provisioning, configuration management, and championing SRE practices.

I work on the [WinOps SRE](https://github.com/google/winops) team at Google,
helping maintain our open source Windows imaging tool called
[Glazier](https://github.com/google/glazier) and BeyondCorp imaging utility
called [Fresnel](https://github.com/google/glazier).

I ‚ù§Ô∏è open source. I aim to work entirely on open-source projects both
professionally and personally.

## Travel

When I think about what truly makes me happy ‚Äî it's travel.
{:.faded}

At 22, I set the goal of traveling to 30 countries before turning 30.
At 22, I'd only been to 1 country outside the US. By 26, I traveled to 29 countries in
4 years, and hit my goal well ahead of time. Onwards to experiencing more
cultures‚Äîmaybe *40 countries before 40*?
