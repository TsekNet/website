## Work

Learning is my biggest motivator.
{:.faded}

Windows Systems Administrator with an unhealthy addiction to automation and SRE
practices.

With over 5 years experience in IT, my primary areas of focus are
PowerShell, Python, automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery,
infrastructure as code, imaging/provisioning, configuration management,
and championing SRE practices.

At Google, I help maintain our open-source Windows imaging tool
([Glazier](https://github.com/google/glazier)).

I ❤️ open-source. My aim is to work entirely on open-source projects both
professionally and personally.

## Travel

When I think about what truly makes me happy — it's travel.

At 22, I set the goal of traveling to 30 countries before turning 30.
At 22, I'd only been to 1 country outside the US. By 26, I traveled to 29 countries in
4 years, and hit my goal well ahead of time. Onwards to experiencing more
cultures — and possibly 40 countries before 40.
