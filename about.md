## Work

Learning is my biggest motivator.
{:.faded}

Windows Systems Administrator with an unhealthy addiction to automation and SRE
practices.

With over five years of experience in IT, my primary areas of focus are
PowerShell, Python, automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery,
infrastructure as code, imaging/provisioning, configuration management,
and championing SRE practices.

At Google, I help maintain our open-source Windows imaging tool
([Glazier](https://github.com/google/glazier)).

I ‚ù§Ô∏è open-source. I aim to work entirely on open-source projects both
professionally and personally.

## Travel

When I think about what truly makes me happy ‚Äî it's travel.
{:.faded}

At 22, I set the goal of traveling to 30 countries before turning 30.
At 22, I'd only been to 1 country outside the US. By 26, I traveled to 29 countries in
4 years, and hit my goal well ahead of time. Onwards to experiencing more
cultures ‚Äî and possibly 40 countries before 40.
